- Sprites have been handpicked to resemble a bit more their original versions but in HD form.
- Many of the weapon sprites have been fixed to resemble the actual weapons their represent
- Opposing force weapon sprites (and others like the uzi), have fixed scanlines and effects for consistency
- HUD sprites now have Sven Co-op fonts
