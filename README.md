## Description

Replaces hud and particle effects, handpicked to resemble the original designs in HD, and also fixing several inconsistencies and bugs.
This goes well with the Nostalgia weapon pack and was made alongside it.

- Sprites have been handpicked to resemble a bit more their original versions but in HD form.
- Many of the weapon sprites have been fixed to resemble the actual weapons their represent
- Opposing force weapon sprites (and others), have fixed scanlines and effects for consistency
- HUD sprites now have Sven Co-op fonts
